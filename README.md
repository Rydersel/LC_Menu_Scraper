# LC_Menu_Scraper (Work in Progress)


## The Problem:

Everyday me and my roomate have the same conversation. It breaks down to me asking him whats for dinner at our schools dining hall, and him looking up whats for diunner. It takes 6 clicks to get this information which 
is way too much time for busy Comp Sci majors like me and my roomate. So instead lets spend hours writting a web scraper to scrape what is for dinner each day and automatically text it to me. 



## Future Roadmap:

-Allow users to schedule to recieve meals at a set time.

-Allow users to rate meal quality and then display average meal quality ratings when returning items.
